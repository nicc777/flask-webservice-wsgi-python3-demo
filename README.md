# Flask Web Services Example on Linux with Apache 2 and WSGI

## Introduction

I have battled through a number of tutorials to try and get a basic Flask web services application going, using the following stack:

* Linux (Debian)
* Apache 2
* WSGI
* Python 3

Have a look further down below at the section for "Further Reading" of the resources I have consulted in order to arrive at this demo application.

## Further Reading

There were many resources I have used in putting this tutorial together, so overall I want to thank all the Python contributors on sites like stackoverflow which I use intensively almost on a daily basis - you guys rock! I wish I took down all the pages I used for this demo, but unfortunately I did not track it from the start, so I will just acknowledge for now the main non-stackoverflow resources I used.

1. The first site I used was by [Tero Karvinen](http://terokarvinen.com/2016/deploy-flask-python3-on-apache2-ubuntu "Deploy Flask & Python3 on Apache2 & Ubuntu")
2. Then there was a good WSGI tutorial (python 2 based) from [Christian Hettlage](http://software.saao.ac.za/2014/10/29/deploying-a-flask-application-on-apache/ "Deploying a Flask application on Apache")
3. Of course there is the official [Flask Site](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/ "Flask")

I also need to mention two books I used extensively to learn Flask and which put me on this journey in the first place:

1. The first book was [Flask Web Development](http://www.flaskbook.com "Flask Web Development") by [Miguel Grinberg](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg "GitHub")
2. The second book I used extensively was [Essential SQLAlchemy](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035800.do "Essential SQLAlchemy")
